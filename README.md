## Overview

### Description

PaperTrader is a mobile app that simulates real-time stock trading with virtual money. It helps beginners learn how to trade, track portfolios, and understand the stock market without financial risk. The app also includes learning modules and a community forum where users can share tips and strategies in a simple, modern interface.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Financial Literacy/Education

- **Mobile:** The app is designed for mobile use on Android devices. Users can access all trading and learning features from their phones at any time, allowing them to practice trading, read educational content, and engage with the community wherever they are.

- **Story:** PaperTrader began as a solution to a common challenge faced by new traders: the lack of an accessible, realistic, and easy-to-use demo trading app. Inspired by personal experience, the app helps users learn trading concepts, simulate stock investments, and connect with a community of peers without the financial risks of real markets. It combines a clean, modern interface with real stock data and interactive learning modules to make financial literacy practical and engaging.

- **Market:** The app targets beginner and intermediate investors, especially college students and young adults who are interested in learning how to trade. It also appeals to educators who want to incorporate stock trading simulations into financial literacy programs. PaperTrader fills a gap between overly complex trading platforms and overly simplified learning tools.

- **Habit:** Users are encouraged to build consistent trading habits by checking their portfolios daily, participating in community discussions, and completing short learning modules. The goal is to promote routine financial awareness and long-term investment education rather than impulsive or short-term trading.
- **Scope:** The project focuses on creating a fully functional Android app prototype with key features:
	•	Live stock data integration (using Yahoo Finance API)
	•	Buy/sell simulation with a virtual balance
	•	Portfolio tracking and watchlist functionality
	•	Educational modules on trading fundamentals
	•	A community forum for peer discussion
Future scope includes expanding to iOS, adding gamification (leaderboards, challenges), and enhancing data visualization tools for advanced analytics.
